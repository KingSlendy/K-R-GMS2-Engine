# KingSlendy & RedBatNick GMS2 Engine

This is an IWBTG fangame engine made for GameMaker Studio 2.

It's an engine I (KingSlendy) made from scratch, basing it on YoYo's GMS1 engine, with using the new things GMS2 brings to the table.

It completely ditches solids and has a new and more compact save system, with a ton of different gimmicks and objects from other fangames (RedBatNick).

It has native [I Wanna Play Online](https://iwpo.dappermink.com) support, you can play with your friends very easily!

It also has a really extensive and complex trigger system, but fear not because it's really easy to use! It allows for manipulation of any variable in any object, giving you an insane amount of potential!

We plan on expanding this further and adding more things as time goes on!

If you find any bugs or undesired behavior then message either: @kingslendy or @redbatnick
