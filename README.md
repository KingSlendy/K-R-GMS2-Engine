# KingSlendy & RedBatNick GMS2 Engine

This is an IWBTG fangame engine made for GameMaker Studio 2
It's an engine I (KingSlendy) made from scratch, basing it on YoYo's GMS1 engine, with using the new things GMS2 brings to the table
It completely ditches solid and has a new and more compact save system, with a ton of different gimmicks and objects from other fangames (RedBatNick)
We plan on expanding this further and adding more things as time goes on!

If you find any bugs or undesired behavior then message either: KingSlendy#6578 or RedBatNick#6751

This a game engine I tried to adapt to work without solids but trying to be as accurate as possible to Yuuutu physics
Everything was made entirely from scratch, but heavily based on YoYo's engine

It also has support for IWPO integrated within the engine itself

I might still update this occasionally if I receive suggestions or bug reports
If you have any please send them to me on my Discord: KingSlendy#6578

Also sorry for the lack of documentation! I need to work on that (hopefully)
