# KingSlendy & RedBatNick GMS2 Engine

This is an IWBTG fangame engine made for GameMaker Studio 2
It's an engine I (KingSlendy) made from scratch, basing it on YoYo's GMS1 engine, with using the new things GMS2 brings to the table
It completely ditches solid and has a new and more compact save system, with a ton of different gimmicks and objects from other fangames (RedBatNick)
We plan on expanding this further and adding more things as time goes on!

If you find any bugs or undesired behavior then message either: KingSlendy#6578 or RedBatNick#6751
